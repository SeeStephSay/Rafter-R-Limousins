                    <div class="half-width"><p>We are a small ranch, situated on approximately 500 acres, in small-town Stratford, Oklahoma. We are owned by Richard Atzbach - who is also a local pastor and the owner of the Car Care Center in town. We are proud to house approximately 50 head of cattle, with 10 full-blood Limousins.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="half-width"><p>A severe drought several years ago led to us having to sell off most of our Limousin herd, but we are in the process of building our stock back up now. Limousin cattle have always been Richard's passion, and he would love to discuss them with you anytime if you'd like to give him a call!</p>
